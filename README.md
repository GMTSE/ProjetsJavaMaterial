# Material for Java Projects

You'll be asked to respect as much as possible the *Good Coding Practices* from Java by Comparison.

At least, you MUST respect the following rules: 

* General
    * Rule#5 (always check for null - args...)
    * Rule#8/Rule#14 (group code that goes together / indent)
    * Rule#72 (log in file rather than console)
    * Also important
        * Rule#11 (favor for-each)
        * Rule#15 (use string format)
        * Rule#68 (define code style for the whole team)

* Comments
    * Rule#21 (=template)

* Naming
    * Rule#29 (select good names)

* Exceptions
    * Rule#34 (catch most specific Exception)
    * Rule#39 (close resources)

* Testing
    * Rule#42 (=template)
    * Rule#50 (treat edge cases)

* Design
    * Rule#54 (favor immutable)

* Java8
    * Rule#64 (use optionals rather than nulls)
